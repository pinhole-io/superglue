"""Example 15: Rate limiting — capping requests per second.

`requests_per_second` installs a token-bucket limiter shared across every
request made by the client (completions, tool calls, streaming). The limiter
ensures the throughput never exceeds the cap regardless of how many calls are
made concurrently.

This example fires 6 requests as fast as possible with a 2 req/s cap and
prints the elapsed time so you can see the limiter in action.
