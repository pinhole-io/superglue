# Superglue design documentation

This directory holds **maintainer-facing design notes** for the `superglue` polyglot LLM orchestration core. The Rust crate lives at [`../`](../); the Python binding lives at [`../../superglue-py/`](../../superglue-py/).

These documents describe **intent, tradeoffs, and current implementation status**. They are versioned with the repo and updated as decisions change.

## Reading order

1. [Vision and principles](01-vision-and-principles.md) — goals, constraints, non-goals.
2. [Architecture](02-architecture.md) — what runs in the Rust core versus language bindings.
3. [Tool boundary and async](03-tool-boundary-and-async.md) — JSON tool payloads, Tokio ownership, bridging async hosts.
4. [Protobuf, gRPC, and workflows](04-protobuf-grpc-and-workflows.md) — internal schema, RPC surface, deployment modes.
5. [Observability](05-observability.md) — tracing, metrics, and safe export of telemetry.
6. [Security and threat model](06-security-and-threat-model.md) — tiered posture from commercial packaging to high-assurance patterns.
7. [Network privacy and telemetry shaping](07-network-privacy-and-telemetry-shaping.md) — optional traffic-shaping ideas; legal and ethical caveats.
8. [Operations: throttled downloads](08-operations-throttled-downloads.md) — rate-limited artifact fetch.
9. [Roadmap and phasing](09-roadmap-and-phasing.md) — incremental delivery plan with current status.
10. [Ecosystem reference](10-ecosystem-reference.md) — Rust crates in use and prior art.
11. [LLM Gateway](12-llm-gateway.md) — HTTP proxy with keys, budgets, and usage tracking (`gateway` feature).
